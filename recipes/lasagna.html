    <h1> How to make Lasagna</h1>
    <img src="../images/lasagna.jpeg">
    <p>To make lasagna, start by cooking minced meat with onions, garlic, and tomato sauce to create a rich filling. In a separate pot, prepare a creamy béchamel sauce. Layer boiled lasagna sheets with meat sauce, béchamel, and shredded cheese in a baking dish. Repeat the layers, finishing with cheese on top. Bake in a preheated oven at 180°C (350°F) for about 30–40 minutes until golden and bubbling. Let it rest before serving for best texture.</p>
